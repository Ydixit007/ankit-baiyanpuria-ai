He rose to fame on June 27, when he completed the 75 Hard Challenge successfully. Originally started by US-based author-entrepreneur Andy Frisella in 2020, the challenge involves going on a strict carb-free diet, performing two 45-minute workouts, drinking a gallon of water, and steering clear of cheat meals and alcohol. A big part of why Baiyanpuria has found a legion of fans, most of them desi millennials and Gen Z is his love for all things desi. The wrestling sensation always opened his workout videos with the phrase “Ram Ram Sareya Ne” which endeared him to a lot of small-town youth.As he kept on sharing numerous traditional workouts and mental health + self-advocacy lessons from the Bhagavad Gita, his popularity spread far and wide. Promote desi / home workouts and diet plans over everything.
